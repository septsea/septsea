Well. More information.

This kind of self-introduction was inspired by the YouTube video [https://youtu.be/V4L3YuhCUEY](https://youtu.be/V4L3YuhCUEY). A copy of that can be found at [https://b23.tv/av804459905](https://b23.tv/av804459905).

In British English slang, a *git* is a foolish or worthless person. I redefined it to be a person who uses `Git`. Maybe a more common way is to say *a `Git` user*.

~~I wrote a book on polynomials (my `strange-book-zero` repository), but that is not very good.~~ ~~*(The quality of source code of the book is so poor that the book cannot be complied properly without a considerable amount of time and effort.)*~~

~~I wrote another math book (my `calculus-with-almost-no-variables` repository). It plays calculus with almost no variables.~~

~~I used to have a Zhihu account.~~

I wrote ~~two~~ three math books, but none of them was not successful at all.
